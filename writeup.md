PSO: Group Direction in Prides
The best position in the pride influences where lions in a pride would roam. When doing roaming female and male lions would have a bit of influence from the direction and distance to the best position in the pride. This will have a constant which dictates the weight of the group direction on how each lion roams. The group direction will be dictated by the best position found in a pride. Every lion who would roam in pride will be attracted to the direction of the best position in territory. This would help lions have neighborhood searching to improve on the best solution the pride has.

Fitness Weighted Mating
Averaging between males for mating can be improved by weighting fitness values to be mated to a female. The best male lion in mating will have more influence on the traits of the offspring. In evolution, the organisms with the better gene always survive. In group mating between multiple males and a female it is better for the alpha male to have more influence on the gene of the offspring. This would help solutions to improve better in prides by giving offspring to be better solutions. Using inverse distance weighting.

Annealing in Nomads
The nomads will have a lower bound fitness that wouldn’t accept any lion that has fitness outside the lower bound. In an evolving environment, nomads would need to quickly adapt to the changes. Nomads, unlike resident lions, have no other lions to rely on when in a bind. Simulating this in the algorithm, annealing, where a lower bound fitness that would reject newly added solutions who has fitness worse than the lower bound.

Improved Ranked Selection Randomization
Using rand(0,1)^k can improve the probability of selecting higher ranked individuals on some sections of the algorithm. By adapting to curve from linear random generated value, lower values, where the rank is higher, would be create better chances for higher ranked individuals to be selected.

Nomad Lion Velocity
Aside from randomly jumping in the search space, nomad lions should also roam using a personal velocity and direction. The velocity should be influenced by the fitness improvement of the lion. A fitness improvement results in less speed to imply convergence to an optima while in other cases should speed up to get to more distances.
