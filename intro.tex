\section{Introduction}
\par The main feature of the Lion Optimization Algorithm is its degree of adaptability tightly coupled on the parameters used. Depending on the fitness function and parameters used, it could find a sweet spot in between to have better performance than other algorithms. An improvement is made to extend the functionality of the Optimization Algorithm. The improvement utilizes more information that is generated within the algorithm to further improve on its functionality.

\par This is a research of a multi-part improvement to the Lion Optimization Algorithm. The improvement is done across multiple sections of the algorithm to improve the overall performance of every run. Most of this improvements are also modeled heuristically after lions, their influence to another, their nature and broadly, evolution in general.
